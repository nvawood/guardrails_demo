    "NeMo Guardrails is an open-source toolkit for easily adding programmable guardrails to LLM-based conversational applications. Guardrails (or “rails” for short) are specific ways of controlling the output of a large language model, such as not talking about politics, responding in a particular way to specific user requests, following a predefined dialog path, using a particular language style, extracting structured data, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we'll see how input, output, and dialog rails can be used to prevent the Large Language Model from discussing particular text-- in this case, a malicious code sample. A malicious code example is tough or impossible to block with traditional tools because it cannot be matched by using regular expressions. Large Language Models are great for preventing this type of abuse."

The configuration directory contains the main configuration file, `config.yml`, which defines the input, output, and dialog rails; `prompts.yml`, which includes the function definitions required by the rails; and a Colang script defining the appropriate usage of the LLM, `rails/disallowed.co`. Let's take a look at our input rails as an example:\n",
